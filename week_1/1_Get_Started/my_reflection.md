## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

1) So far, I haven't had any trouble setting up git and Github (knock on wood... well, laminate). I followed the instructions point by point and luckily didn't hit any snags, at least not yet. In the process of installing git, I learned that git and Github are not the same thing!

2) Git vs. Github - SUPRISE! Not the same thing!
    Git is version control software, which you install and run from your command line. What is version control software? Basically, it is program that allows you to save diferent versions of your code as you go. This is an advantage, because you can mess around with your code and make tweaks without worrying about making some sort of fatal flaw to the existing code. You can integrate the changes to the existing/main code when you're ready. To say that you install and run from your command line means that rather than downloading git software and installing it from the internet through a browser (say, the way you'd download a program like Sykpe via your Chrome browser), you downloand and install and run it via your terminal, using the command line. Don't worry! The instructions tell you exactly what commands to write into the terminal!
    One big distinction between Git and Github is that Git lives in your computer, locally. It does not live on the internet. Conversely, Github lives on the internet, and thus you can access Github remotely, say from other computers. To access work you've done in Git remotely, on the internet, you have to explicitly send it there via the command "git push".
    And what is Github? It's an online site where programmers can share their code and work collaboratively together. You "push" your work from git onto Github, so that it is remotely accessible to yourself and others.
    
2) Version control software allows you to save different versions of you code as you go along. You save these different versions of code inside "branches." You can edit, experiment, and tweak code as much as you want by creating these branches, without affecting the main or preceding code (analogously, you can picture the "main" code as the trunk where the branches uh, branch out, from). Once you find code you like, you can keep just that branch of code, and toss the rest. 
  Github helps with version control software by providing an easily accesible place on the internet for coders to access their code that they've created using version control in git. 
  
3) Developers use version control because they are able to tweak, edit, add to, etc code, without having to potentially screw up the existing code that works. Since they are able to work within branches, they are able to effectively augment code without fear of screwing up their own existing code, or others' existing code. 
  This makes complete sense to me. When I was in college and first playing with code, I would just block code off with comments in order to experiment and tweak, and this was highly inefficient. And messy looking. Having a branch system seems much more elegant and efficient. 
  
  4) I think so far, things make sense. Not to say that I understand everything about the nuances of git and github. For example. I'm definitely going to have to look up every command when I do something in Git. I'm sure that eventually I will have them memorized, but definitely not yet. 
    So far, I understand that you need to push things from Git in order to access them from Github, but other than that, I am a little unclear as to how else they interract with one another.
