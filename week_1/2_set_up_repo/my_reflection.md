## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) To create a repository on GitHub, first navigate to your personal GitHub homepage. Click on the Repositories tab. Click the green "New Button" in the right hand corner. Name your new repository "[Username].github.io" in the repository name field (replace Username with your Github username!), select the "public" radio button rather than private, check the box to "Initialize this repository with a README," and select MIT License under the "Add a License" drop down. Hit the green button at the bottom to create your repository! Boom!
  Now that your repository exists on GitHub, we need to make it exist on your local computer, meaning we need to clone the repository to your local computer. To do this, from your computer, open the GitHub app. In the sidebar, click on your username to view your repositories. Select the "[USERNAME].github.io" you just created, using the search bar tool if necessary to locate it. Next to that repository name, click the "Clone to computer" button. Et voila!
  
2) Open source means that your code is open and available for the public to view, edit, and modify. It fosters the spirit of collaborative programming! Many people open their work to the world in this manner, because they want others to build on and share their code. 

3)Open Source licensing does not make me nervous or protective, at least not yet. I think collaborative coding makes a lot of sense - after all, it is what basically every tech company is founded on - a team that comes together to create a bigger and better product(s). While open source is more open than that, many large companies (like Google) release a lot of their code via open source licensing, their android code for example. It does feel a bit like Utopia yes, lolz.

4) It seems like the importance in using licensing is that you specifically grant and restrict other people's use of your open source code, depending on which license you use. For example, some licenses (like the MIT License we used in this exercise) grant very broad access and usage rights to others. Others, like the Apache 2.0 open source license are more restrictive. 

5) In this challenge, I think my concept of Git and Github and how they interract was slightly solidified. Didn't really have any "aha!" Oprah moments, but I DO enjoy learning about Git and Github very much. 

6) Nope! The background reading in these exercises have been very illuminating thus far, haven't felt a need to look elsewhere yet.
