## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) 2 new things I learned about the web are 1- that the first web page was created/live on August 6, 1991. I was 6 years old! 2- "web development" is the process of programming dynamic web applications. This is a very handy and quick definition, I have always had trouble describing web development to those who ask me!

2) Some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site are:
- all the files for your site should be stored within the same folder
- In order to put any type of media on your website, you have to use its particular HTML tag. 

3) It was exciting to see my web page live! It's been a looooong time since I created my first basic HTML site back in my college days.

4) Did I have any aha moments or were any concepts solidified? Nope not at this time. :)

5) Nope!
