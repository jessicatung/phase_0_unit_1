## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) So far, I think everything I have learned in re: HTML makes sense. 
2) Good: straight-forward, logical, clean. Bad: Slow.
3) I did have a very small aha moment. When using the external method to link my html and css pages, I initially had some issues. I added the link into the <head> of my html page, and didn't understand why the changes I made in my css page didn't show when I viewed the html page. I thought I did everything right. Then, I realized I only put "dbc1.css" as the href location, but I needed to put the WHOLE FILE PATH or else how the hell would they be able to link? DUH. 
4) I didn't find anything on my own, but on the G+ community page, Whitney included a link to the sublime text build that would allow you to view your html/css within your chosen browser using cmd-b. VERY USEFUL.
