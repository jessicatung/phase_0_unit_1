1) I cound this challenge to be pretty tough actually, and I got stressed out. Had a busy week at work, and an orchestra gig on Saturday night, so didn't get to the solo challenge until Sunday. My biggest question was: how the f#@$ do you get the sidebar and content area to format correctly? I ended up mostly using the optional resource guide "An advanced guide to HTML and CSS" to try and find an answer, using floats. I also had a hard time finding a way to center the content area in the browser. That same resource talked about the container class and centering, and I used it, but I'm not sure it WORKED. I also needed help with positioning a caption absolutely over a relative image. I found this that helped: http://css-tricks.com/text-blocks-over-image/

2) I still find all the different positioning methods very complicated. 

3) Pretty much everything I learned about CSS was new.

4) Eh, not that confident. I think html and css are definitely not my strong suit.  I felt uncomfortable looking stuff up, because I know we're not supposed to plaigiarize, but at the same time... it's not like I can figure out how to format html/css out of thin air. I needed outside resources, period. 

I also feel like the learning competencies are confusing in scope. And the way the exercises were presented kind of didn't fit the way the learning competencies were laid out. For example, i really fixated on having to have the sidebar and content be side by side, but I didn't get that to work via "positioning html elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins" as stated in the learning competencies, but rather, via floats. ARGH! :)

5) I'm gonna be honest, I didn't enjoy any part of this challenge. Maybe the part where I included an image of a baby sloth.

6) I found this entire challenge to be hard and tedious! Haha
