## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://jessicatung.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I did enjoy the process! It was much less stressful than the solo challenge, which made me want to rip my hair out. I'm cutting it close to the wire, time-wise, so I didn't get to make it as spiffy and cool looking as I would like... Hopefully my cohort-mates understand. :)
My css page doesn't appear to be working ("There isn't a github page here" error message!), but I know it's linked correctly to my html and I pushed it to update. Hopefully it loads soon....
