Hey Igor, Gunnari, and Ian!

Sorry for the super-late email, clearly I am running behind. :)

My name is Jessica, and I am currently located in the Oakland/East Bay area. The 3 favorite sites that I listed on my technical blog are: The Oatmeal, MetalSucks.net (a misleading website name, the site is entirely about how metal is awesome), and Icanhascheezburger. 

Gregoric Thinking Style(s): Concrete Sequential and Abstract Sequential.
VARC learning style: Multimodal (Read/Write)

Hope you guys had a lovely weekend, and have a great start to the week!

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I think it feels reassuring to know that other people are worried like I am. It made me feel better to know that I have kindred spirits. This week has definitely kicked my ass, and we've just gotten started! But at the same time, it reaffirms that this is where I want to be. Even after a long week of work/commuting and violin gigging, I was happy to sit and work for hours on this week's challenges. I feel engaged, excited, scared, all kinds of feelings.... I'm definitely disappointed in myself that I didn't finish this week's work on time, and I'm a few hours late. I'm hoping to do better as we progress, I have been extremely impressed by my cohort's blogs!
