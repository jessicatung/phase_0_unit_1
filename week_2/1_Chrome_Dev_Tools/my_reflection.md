# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

		I initially had a very hard time wrapping my head around what the hell the DOM is. I feel like I am understanding how to manipulate things in the DOM, but I still don't really "get it" conceptually. I linked to the about.com page about DOM, and it described DOM as "the glue that binds together" the HTML and javascript. That sort of helps with the conceptual bit. Still don't really know how to describe it, and quite frankly, most of the resources I've found don't do that bang-up of a job describing it either. Feh!
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
		Um, so maybe i'm missing something, but my github.io site is still a bare-bones index page linking to my cultural and technical blogs from last week (which, let's be frank here, are pretty bare bones as well lol, goddamn it). So yeah, ANY wordpress site is gonna blow my shit out of the water. I HAVE no Css to manipulate via the Chrome Web Tools on my github site...
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
		I found it SUPER helpful and fun to edit the HTML and CSS with, fairly intuitive, and easy to fuck around with. I definitely got way confused once I was learning about the javascript debugging. Maybe it's because I know very little about javascript (shit! I knew i should have done more of the codecademy javascript stuff during prep!). Hopefully that clears up next week when we learn more about javascript, because that shit confused the... uh, shit... out of me. Not literally, but figuratively.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
		I picture Oprah and her "aha moments" on super soul sunday when I contemplate this question, and quite frankly, none of my moments of clarity have been that illuminating. But i'm not talking to Deepak Chopra here. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	Just that About.com page on DOM that I mentioned above, here: http://webdesign.about.com/od/dom/a/aa120202a.htm. I think I originally linked to it from that skillcrush page that was linked as part of the challenge. So I didn't really "find it on my own" per se.
