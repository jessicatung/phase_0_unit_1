# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

	I don't know if web standards are good or bad, but they do seem PRACTICAL to have. For example, since screen sizes vary, standardizing your design ensures that things won't get too wonky looking when displayed on different size screens.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

	Yes, I think so, expecially after Gunnari and I went over some stuff from last week's challenges during our pairing. I think it makes sense to set content area, set up wrappersto center content if screen width is wider than your content, etc. again for the sake of practicality!
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

	I really do like the new HTML5 elements. I think they intuitively make more sense, they help prevent "Div-itis" (something I really suffered from during last week's challenges), and visually remove a TON of clutter. 
* Why is reset.css necessary? 

	Since developing css on different browsers etc still gives people problems, css reset files offer an easy solution. 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

	I have used basically every browser, but now that most of my devices are apple products, I mostly use chrome (and safari, when chrome is acting up or not working for something). Every once in a while I notice that sites look different depending on what browser I'm using, but haven't noticed anything glaring in quite some time. I don't know about BAD but it is kind of inconvenient that sometimes this happens, and I suppose that's why web standards exist.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
