# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

	The treehouse blog describes responsive web design as a set of techniques and ideas that form a whole - it is designed to address the issues that arise from displaying web pages on a whole variety of displays - computers, smart phone screens, large HD screens, etc. 
	I do like responsive web design, it seems like a logical solution to this issue and a good practice. I do remember the advent of mobile versions of websites, and I agree with this blog article when it said that "creating a different version of a website that targets each individual device is not a practical way forward." I feel like responsive web design goes kind of hand-in-hand with the last sections materials on standardization. It's a more practical and efficient move towards standardization and uniform displays across different platforms.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

	As the blog article mentioned, smartphones and tablets have changed web design because people expect to be able to surf the web as easily and effectively on their phones and tablets as they do on their computers. Thus, developers must keep this in mind when designing webpages. 
	I don't know how new technology will change web design in the future, but it is clear that technology moves at lightning speed, and web design must keep up with consumer demand. I think the trend will be towards more standardization, and optimization, across all platforms.Things like HTML5 and responsive web design will become standard practice across the board, and probably even more methadologies will arise to address this issue in an even more effective and efficient manner.


* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

	I actually witnessed this in action the other day while waiting at work to take my g-bus home. A visually impaired girl had her smart phone held up to her ear, and was using her finger to scroll/swipe across it as some sort of voice technology read aloud what was on the screen. She was checking her email, and it seemed like she was also browsing the web, but I'm not sure. I remember thinking that was really neat, since it's not like we can make smartphones have on-demand tactile braille that changes for every webpage they load (at least not yet). Absolutely, we should design and develop for them. 


* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

	So far, the ideas and concepts that have resonated with me the most are the ones involving standardization and optimization across all (or most, in practice) platforms. I remember (not that long ago) trying to pull up pages on my smartphone, and getting so fed up at the terrible formatting and inconvenience of browsing on my phone and thinking to myself, "I'll just pull this page up later when I'm on a real computer." This feeling is becoming more and more rare, and I think that's all due to things like responsive web design. Nothing really seems "stupid" to me yet, I think it's neat that technology keeps moving forward in a way to meet these types of needs and concerns.
