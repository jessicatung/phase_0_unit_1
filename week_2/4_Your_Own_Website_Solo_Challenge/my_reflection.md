# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://jessicatung.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
	
	What I learned about design is that it's ok to get inspiration from others. If you look at many different sites, do your research, pull ideas and inspiration from MANY, tweak and adjust to your own taste, give credit where credit is due, it's totally ok. 

	What I learned about user experience is that UX is HOW a person feels when interfacing with a system (whether it be a website, we application, etc) - in other words, how a person feels during some form of human-computer interaction. It is distinct from usability. Usability addresses user-friendliness and efficiency of the interface. UX focuses on how the person feels about a system, and examines things such as utility, ease of use, perception of the value of the system, etc. 

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
	
	I think that I like design a lot, but feel neutral towards user experience. I suppose I did consider user experience to an extent when I was creating my site, but definitely focused on design way more. It was fun tweaking the design of my site, especially since it was SO bare-bones before.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

	My process involved a lot of thinking in my head about how I wanted my site to look, a lot of research looking at my fellow classmates blog sites and gleaning inspiration from all (ie. loving how many people put their picture on their blog site, how some used background images, etc). After this brainstorming and research, I started putting together my wireframe and ideas of how I wanted my site to look. I wanted to keep it simple, but provide all the relevant info, and make it aesthetically pleasing (at least to me).

	The one thing I couldn't figure out was how to have different link styles in the sidebar, than from the main content area. 

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

	Not sure yet! But I'm sure as I do more research, and think on it more, I'll come up with something. I've been steadily working on my site for the last couple days, and I kept coming up with things I wanted to add or tweak, and running to my computer to do it.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
	
	I'd say applying the material I've learned so far has been moderately challenging. I think a lot of my classmates have WAY cooler blog pages than mine, and really incorporate many of the new materials and skills we've learned. I think I was trying to strike a balance between having the page look how I want,  improve it by implementing some of the new material I learned, but not spend an inordinate amount of time on it. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

	When I was working on my tech blog this week, I found this link which was helpful on borders:
