# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

	My biggest challenge is trying to get my Phase 0 work done on time while still working a full-time job. Last week, I made the mistake of leaving most of my DBC work until the weekend, and I ended up having to stay up until 2:30 AM scrambling to turn in my challenges, and felt like my results were sub-par. Plus, it sucked having to function on 3 hours of sleep the next day at work, haha. My job takes up a lot of time, and I have a 1.5-2.5 hour commute (EACH WAY, argh), so time is eaten up really quickly during the work week. It's a bit of a struggle finding time to work on the DBC challenges.

* How will you combat that? 

	Trying to get at least some DBC work done during the weekdays. I've been trying to work during my shuttle commute, but I can only manage about 30 minutes or so before I get too car sick to continue. But this week, I found that by trying to at least sit down every night and get some headway on the DBC challenges, I got much farther by the time I reached the weekend than I did last week. I would also like to start implementing some of the new techniques I read about this week.


* What techniques will you try?

	It was cool to read more about meditation, after being introduced to the idea of mindful meditation practice for engineers in Chade-Meng Tan's book. I think it would be beneficial for me to try to incorporate a daily meditation practice, it would help me manage my stress level, and clear my mind. I have also heard about the Pomodoro technique before, outside of this week's materials, but hearing about it again was a good sign that it's a technique that I should consider implementing. Even if the name "pomodoro technique" makes me crave pasta and want to take a snack break... :)


* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

	I am still working on formulating my overall plan for Phase 0. I think that continuing to get DBC work done throughout the week is going to be integral. Making sure that I absorb as much information as possible, without beating myself up when I feel like I don't understand every little detail. Continuing to reach out to my cohort-mates when I need help, and making myself available if anyone else wants my help!
