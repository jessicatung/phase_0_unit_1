    <h1>Pair Programming!!</h1>
  </header>
  
  <section>
    <p>Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. </p>
    <p>While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This frees the driver to focus all of his or her attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>We both agree that the vibe worked well between us, and it was a success! Our guide did a good job introducing us to our first GPS, setting the expectations, and getting us comfortable. By the time we started our pairing session, we got into the flow and were able to move at a quick pace! Our guide was also helpful in steering us in the right direction when we were getting of track, but otherwise let us pair on our own. We both agree that our partner was good at navigating us when we'd make a mistake in typing. We are agreed that we each did a good job as both driver and navigating. Communication was great!</p>
